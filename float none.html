        <p>In terms of power, the V-12, twin-turbo 6.8-litre engine produces the same 563-horsepower and 627-lb-ft of torque it makes on the Cullinan. Power reaches the wheels, thanks to an 8-speed automatic gearbox and a wildcard all-wheel-drive system, the first entry of its kind in Rolls-Royce books. The Ghost is also said to pull 0-to-60-mph in 4.6 seconds and will have a top speed limited to 155-mph.

            Rolls-Royce is yet to unveil the pricing and the availability of the Gen-2 Ghost in India. However, weâ€™re expecting a hefty Rs 6 crore plus price-tag in India.</p>
